# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### ANJALI SURESAN

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: Initially, I was unable to submit the predictions due to the error:'kaggle: not found'. This was solved using the '!pip install -U kaggle" command. Secondly, the negative values in the predictions had to be set to zero before the submission could be made. 

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: The top ranked model was the 'WeightedEnsemble_L3". The evaluation metric used was the root mean squared error. For this model, the validation score was 53.0822 

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: The EDA showed the distribution of the different features relative to the data using a histogram. 
I added two additional features by separating out the datetime into the hour and month features. The season and weather fetaures were also set to "category" 

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: After adding the two additional features and testing the models, the top ranked model (WeightedEnsemble_L3) had a validation score of 30.1709. The added features give additional insights and data for training the model, improving its effectiveness. 

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: After the hyperparameter optimization, the the top ranked model (WeightedEnsemble_L3) had a validation score of 30.1296. This was not a drastic improvement. The hyperparameter changed was mainly the time_limit that was increased to further optimize the model fitting, presets was set to "optimize_for_deployment" which optimizes the model immediately for deploying by deleting the unused training artefacts. In this case, the models WeightedEnsemble_L2, RandomForestMSE_BAG_L2 and ExtraTreesMSE_BAG_L2 were deleted.  

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: Hyperparameter optimization for individual models like optimizing the current 'best' model-"WeightedEnsemble_L3". I did try to optimize hyperparameter tuning for this model using hyperparameter and hyperparameter_tune_kwargs but had a persistent error that I will try to work on. 

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|time_limit|auto_stack|presets|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|600|N/A|best_quality|1.78697|
|add_features|600|N/A|best_quality|0.68622|
|hpo|720|True|optimize_for_deployment|0.70480|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

TODO: Replace the image below with your own.

### Create a line plot showing the top kaggle score for the three (or more) prediction submissions during the project.

TODO: Replace the image below with your own.

## Summary
TODO: The first figure shows the validation score for the top model-WeightedEnsemble_L3. It increases across the three training runs being highest for the hpo model. The second plot shows the kaggle score for the three prediction submissions.
